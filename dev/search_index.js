Manipulating an image in the frequency domain amounts to retaining or discarding particular frequency components—a process analogous to sifting or filtering [1].  Because the Fourier transform establishes a link between the spatial and frequency representation of an image, one can interpret various image manipulations in the spatial domain as filtering operations which accept or reject specific frequencies.\n\nThe phrase spatial filtering is often used to emphasise that an operation is, at least conceptually, devised in the context of the spatial domain of an image. One further distinguishes between linear and non-linear spatial filtering. A filter is called linear if the operation performed on the pixels is linear, and is labeled non-linear otherwise.\n\nAn image filter can be represented by a function\n\n w sin mathbbZ mid -k_1 le s le k_1   times  t in mathbbZ mid -k_2 le t le k_2     rightarrow mathbbR\n\nwhere k_i  in mathbbN (i = 1,2). It is common to define k_1 = 2a+1 and k_2 = 2b + 1, where a and b are integers, which ensures that the filter dimensions are of odd size. Typically, k_1 equals k_2 and so, dropping the subscripts, one speaks of a k times k filter. Since the domain of the filter represents a grid of spatial coordinates, the filter is often called a mask and is visualized as a grid. For example, a 3 times 3 mask can be potrayed as follows:\n\nscriptsize\nbeginmatrix\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(-1-1) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\n\n\n\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(-10) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\n \nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(-11) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\n\n\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(0-1) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\n\n\n\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(00) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\n \nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(01) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\n\n\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(1-1) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\n\n\n\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(10) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\n \nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nphantomw(-9-9) \nw(11) \nphantomw(-9-9) \nendmatrix\n\nendmatrix\n\nThe values of w(st) are referred to as filter coefficients.\n\nDiscrete convolution versus correlation\n\nThere are two fundamental and closely related operations that one regularly performs on an image with a filter. The operations are called discrete correlation and convolution.\n\nThe correlation operation, denoted by the symbol star,  is given in two dimensions by the expression\n\nbeginaligned\ng(xy) = w(xy) star f(xy) = sum_s = -a^a sum_t=-b^b w(st) f(x+s y+t)\nendaligned\n\nwhereas the comparable convolution operation, denoted by the symbol ast, is given in two dimensions by\n\nbeginaligned\nh(xy) = w(xy) ast f(xy) = sum_s = -a^a sum_t=-b^b w(st) f(x-s y-t)\nendaligned\n\nSince a digital image is of finite extent, both of these operations are undefined at the borders of the image. In particular, for an image of size M times N, the function f(x pm s y pm t) is only defined for 1 le x pm s le N and 1 le y pm t le M. In practice one addresses this problem by artificially expanding the domain of the image. For example, one can pad the image with zeros. Other padding strategies are possible, and they are discussed in more detail in the Options section of this documentation.\n\nOne-dimensional illustration\n\nThe difference between correlation and convolution is best understood with recourse to a one-dimensional example  adapted from [1]. Suppose that a filter w-101rightarrow mathbbR has coefficients\n\nbeginmatrix\nboxed1  boxed2  boxed3\nendmatrix\n\nConsider a discrete unit impulse function f x in mathbbZ mid 1 le x le 7   rightarrow 01  that has been padded with zeros. The function can be visualised as an image\n\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\n0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed1  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0  0\nendmatrix\n\nThe correlation operation can be interpreted as sliding w along the image and computing the sum of products at each location. For example,\n\nbeginmatrix\n0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0 \n1  2  3         \n 1  2  3         \n  1  2  3        \n   1  2  3       \n    1  2  3      \n     1  2  3    \n      1  2  3\nendmatrix\n\nyields the output g x in mathbbZ mid 1 le x le 7   rightarrow mathbbR, which when visualized as a digital image, is equal to\n\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nboxed0  boxed0  boxed3  boxed2  boxed1  boxed0  boxed0\nendmatrix\n\nThe interpretation of the convolution operation is analogous to correlation, except that the filter w has been rotated by 180 degrees. In particular,\n\nbeginmatrix\n0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0 \n3  2  1         \n 3  2  1         \n  3  2  1        \n   3  2  1       \n    3  2  1      \n     3  2  1    \n      3  2  1\nendmatrix\n\nyields the output h x in mathbbZ mid 1 le x le 7   rightarrow mathbbR equal to\n\nboxed\nbeginmatrix\nboxed0  boxed0  boxed1  boxed2  boxed3  boxed0  boxed0\nendmatrix\n\nInstead of rotating the filter mask, one could instead rotate f and still obtained the same convolution result. In fact, the conventional notation for convolution indicates that f is flipped and not w. If w is symmetric, then convolution and correlation give the same outcome.\n\nTwo-dimensional illustration\n\nFor a two-dimensional example, suppose the filter w-1 0 1 times  -101 rightarrow mathbbR  has coefficients\n\n beginmatrix\n boxed1  boxed2  boxed3  \n boxed4  boxed5  boxed6  \n boxed7  boxed8  boxed9\n endmatrix\n\nand consider a two-dimensional discrete unit impulse function\n\n fx in mathbbZ mid 1 le x le 7   times  y in mathbbZ mid 1 le y le 7  rightarrow  01\n\nthat has been padded with zeros:\n\n boxed\n beginmatrix\n   0         0          0          0           0          0     0   \n   0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0   boxed0  boxed0    0   \n   0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0   boxed0  boxed0    0  \n   0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed1   boxed0  boxed0    0  \n   0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0   boxed0  boxed0    0  \n   0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0   boxed0  boxed0    0  \n   0         0          0          0           0          0     0\n endmatrix\n\nThe correlation operation w(xy) star f(xy)  yields the output\n\n boxed\n beginmatrix\n boxed0  boxed0   boxed0  boxed0  boxed0  \n boxed0   boxed9  boxed8  boxed7  boxed0  \n boxed0   boxed6  boxed5  boxed4  boxed0  \n boxed0   boxed3  boxed2  boxed1  boxed0  \n boxed0  boxed0   boxed0  boxed0  boxed0\n endmatrix\n\nwhereas the convolution operation w(xy) ast f(xy) produces\n\n boxed\n beginmatrix\n boxed0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0  \n boxed0  boxed1  boxed2  boxed3  boxed0 \n boxed0  boxed4  boxed5  boxed6  boxed0  \n boxed0  boxed7  boxed8  boxed9  boxed0  \n boxed0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0  boxed0\n endmatrix\n\nDiscrete convolution and correlation as matrix multiplication\n\nDiscrete convolution and correlation operations can also be formulated as a matrix multiplication, where one of the inputs is converted to a Toeplitz matrix, and the other is represented as a column vector. For example, consider a function fx in mathbbN mid 1 le x le M  rightarrow mathbbR and a filter w s in mathbbN mid  -k_1 le s le k_1   rightarrow mathbbR. Then the matrix multiplication\n\nbeginbmatrix\nw(-k_1) \t  0\t     ldots\t 0\t\t    0\t\t\t\nvdots \t w(-k_1) \t ldots\t vdots   0\t        \nw(k_1) \t     vdots    ldots\t 0\t\t    vdots    \n0 \t    \t w(k_1)\t ldots    w(-k_1)   0\t\t    \n0 \t         0\t\t     ldots\t vdots   w(-k_1)\t\nvdots      vdots\t ldots\t w(k_1)    vdots\t\n0            0          0\t\t\t 0\t\t    w(k_1)\nendbmatrix\nbeginbmatrix\nf(1) \nf(2) \nf(3) \nvdots \nf(M)\nendbmatrix\n\nis equivalent to the convolution w(s) ast f(x) assuming that the border of f(x) has been padded with zeros.\n\nTo represent multidimensional convolution as matrix multiplication one reshapes the multidimensional arrays into column vectors and proceeds in an analogous manner. Naturally, the result of the matrix multiplication will need to be reshaped into an appropriate multidimensional array.\n\nOptions\n\nThe following subsections describe valid options for the function arguments in more detail.\n\nChoices for r\n\nYou can dispatch to different implementations by passing in a resource r as defined by the ComputationalResources package. For example,\n\n    imfilter(ArrayFireLibs(), img, kernel)\n\nwould request that the computation be performed on the GPU using the ArrayFire libraries.\n\nChoices for T\n\nOptionally, you can control the element type of the output image by passing in a type T as the first argument.\n\nChoices for img\n\nYou can specify a one, two or multidimensional array defining your image.\n\nChoices for kernel\n\nThe kernel[0,0,..] parameter corresponds to the origin (zero displacement) of the kernel; you can use centered to place the origin at the array center, or use the OffsetArrays package to set kernel's indices manually. For example, to filter with a random centered 3x3 kernel, you could use either of the following:\n\nkernel = centered(rand(3,3))\nkernel = OffsetArray(rand(3,3), -1:1, -1:1)\n\nThe kernel parameter can be specified as an array or as a \"factored kernel\", a tuple (filt1, filt2, ...) of filters to apply along each axis of the image. In cases where you know your kernel is separable, this format can speed processing. Each of these should have the same dimensionality as the image itself, and be shaped in a manner that indicates the filtering axis, e.g., a 3x1 filter for filtering the first dimension and a 1x3 filter for filtering the second dimension. In two dimensions, any kernel passed as a single matrix is checked for separability; if you want to eliminate that check, pass the kernel as a single-element tuple, (kernel,).\n\nChoices for border\n\nAt the image edge, border is used to specify the padding which will be used to extrapolate the image beyond its original bounds.

If no choice is specified, one will be chosen based on the size of the image and kernel in a way that strives to deliver good performance. Alternatively you can use a custom filter type, like KernelFactors.IIRGaussian.\n\nExamples\n\nThe following subsections highlight some common use cases.\n\nConvolution versus correlation\n\n\n# Create a two-dimensional discrete unit impulse function.\nf = fill(0,(9,9));\nf[5,5] = 1;\n\n# Specify a filter coefficient mask and set the center of the mask as the origin.\nw = centered([1 2 3; 4 5 6 ; 7 8 9]);\n\n#=\n The default operation of `imfilter` is correlation.  By reflecting `w` we\n compute the convolution of `f` and `w`.  `Fill(0,w)` indicates that we wish to\n pad the border of `f` with zeros.

Alteratively, explicitly provide the indices inds of imgfilt that you want to calculate, and use NoPad boundary conditions. In such cases, you are responsible for supplying appropriate padding: img must be indexable for all of the locations needed for calculating the output.

The gradient points in the direction of maximum rate of change of f_textrmA at the coordinates (x_1x_2). The gradient can be used to compute the derivative of a function in an arbitrary direction. In particular, the derivative of f_textrmA in the direction of a unit vector mathbfu is given by nabla_mathbfuf_textrmA(x_1x_2) = nabla mathbff_textrmA(x_1x_2) cdot mathbfu, where cdot denotes the dot product.\n\nDigital image\n\nIn practice, we acquire a digital image f_textrmD(x_1x_2) where the light intensity is known only at a discrete set of locations. This means that the required partial derivatives are undefined and need to be approximated using discrete difference formulae [1].\n\nA straightforward way to approximate the partial derivatives is to use central-difference formulae\n\n fracpartial f_textrmD(x_1x_2)partial x_1  approx\n        fracf_textrmD(x_1+1x_2) - f_textrmD(x_1-1x_2) 2\n\nand\n\n fracpartial f_textrmD(x_1x_2)partial x_2   approx\n         fracf_textrmD(x_1x_2+1) - f_textrmD(x_1x_2+1)2\n\nHowever, the central-difference formulae are very sensitive to noise. When working with noisy image data, one can obtain a better approximation of the partial derivatives by using a suitable weighted combination of the neighboring image intensities. The weighted combination can be represented as a discrete convolution operation between the image and a kernel which characterizes the requisite weights. In particular, if h_x_d (d = 12) represents a 2r+1 times 2r+1 kernel, then\n\n fracpartial f_textrmD(x_1x_2)partial x_d  approx\nsum_i = -r^r sum_j = -r^r\nf_textrmD(x_1-ix_2-j)\n  h_x_d(ij)\n\nThe kernel is frequently also called a mask or convolution matrix.\n\nWeighting schemes and approximation error\n\nThe choice of weights determines the magnitude of the approximation error and whether the finite-difference scheme is isotropic. A finite-difference scheme is isotropic if the approximation error does not depend on the orientation of the coordinate system and anisotropic if the approximation error has a directional bias [2]. With a continuous analogue image the magnitude of the gradient would be invariant upon rotation of the coordinate system, but in practice one cannot obtain perfect isotropy with a finite set of discrete points. Hence a finite-difference scheme is typically considered isotropic if the leading error term in the approximation does not have preferred directions.\n\nMost finite-difference schemes that are used in image processing are based on 3 times 3 kernels, and as noted by [7], many can also be parametrized by a single parameter alpha as follows:\n\nmathbfH_x_1 =\nfrac14 + 2alpha\nbeginbmatrix\n-1  -alpha  -1 \n0  0  0 \n 1  alpha  1\nendbmatrix\nquad\ntextand\nquad\nmathbfH_x_2 =\nfrac12 + 4alpha\nbeginbmatrix\n-1  0  1 \n-alpha  0  alpha \n -1  0  1\nendbmatrix\n\nwhere\n\nalpha =\nbegincases\n0   textSimple Finite Difference \n1   textPrewitt \n2   textSobel \n24351   textAndo \nfrac103   textScharr \n4   textBickley\nendcases\n\nSeparable kernel\n\nA kernel is called separable if it can be expressed as the convolution of two one-dimensional filters. With a matrix representation of the kernel, separability means that the kernel matrix can be written as an outer product of two vectors. Separable kernels offer computational advantages since instead of performing a two-dimensional convolution one can perform a sequence of one-dimensional convolutions.\n\nOptions\n\nYou can specify your choice of the finite-difference scheme via the kernelfun parameter. You can also indicate how to deal with the pixels on the border of the image with the border parameter.\n\nChoices for kernelfun\n\nIn general kernelfun can be any function which satisfies the following interface:\n\n    kernelfun(extended::NTuple{N,Bool}, d) -> kern_d,\n\nwhere kern_d is the kernel for producing the derivative with respect to the dth dimension of an N-dimensional array. The parameter extended[i] is true if the image is of size > 1 along dimension i. The parameter kern_d may be provided as a dense or factored kernel, with factored representations recommended when the kernel is separable.\n\nSome valid kernelfun options are described below.\n\nKernelFactors.prewitt\n\nWith the prewit option [3] the computation of the gradient is based on the kernels\n\nbeginaligned\nmathbfH_x_1  = frac16\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1  -1  -1 \n    0  0  0 \n    1  1  1\n    endbmatrix\n\nmathbfH_x_2  =  frac16\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1  0  1 \n    -1  0  1 \n    -1  0  1\n    endbmatrix \n = frac16\n    beginbmatrix\n    1 \n    1  \n    1\n    endbmatrix\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1  0  1\n    endbmatrix\n\n = frac16\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1 \n    0  \n    1\n    endbmatrix\n    beginbmatrix\n    1  1  1\n    endbmatrix\nendaligned\n\nSee also: KernelFactors.prewitt and Kernel.prewitt\n\nKernelFactors.sobel\n\nThe sobel option [4] designates the kernels\n\nbeginaligned\nmathbfH_x_1  = frac18\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1  -2  -1 \n     0  0  0 \n     1  2  1\n    endbmatrix\n\nmathbfH_x_2  = frac18\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1  0  1 \n    -2  0  2 \n    -1  0  1\n    endbmatrix \n = frac18\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1 \n    0  \n    1\n    endbmatrix\n    beginbmatrix\n    1  2  1\n    endbmatrix\n\n = frac18\n    beginbmatrix\n    1 \n    2  \n    1\n    endbmatrix\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1  0  1\n    endbmatrix\nendaligned\n\nSee also:  KernelFactors.sobel and Kernel.sobel\n\nKernelFactors.ando3\n\nThe ando3 option [5] specifies the kernels\n\nbeginaligned\nmathbfH_x_1   =\n    beginbmatrix\n    -0112737  -0274526  -0112737 \n     0  0  0 \n     0112737  0274526  0112737\n    endbmatrix\n\nmathbfH_x_2   =\n    beginbmatrix\n    -0112737  0  0112737 \n    -0274526  0  0274526 \n    -0112737  0  0112737\n    endbmatrix \n  = beginbmatrix\n    -1 \n    0  \n    1\n    endbmatrix\n    beginbmatrix\n    0112737  0274526  0112737\n    endbmatrix\n\n  = beginbmatrix\n    0112737 \n    0274526  \n    0112737\n    endbmatrix\n    beginbmatrix\n    -1  0  1\n    endbmatrix\nendaligned\n\nSee also:  KernelFactors.ando3, and Kernel.ando3;  KernelFactors.ando4, and Kernel.ando4; KernelFactors.ando5, and Kernel.ando5\n\nKernelFactors.scharr\n\nThe scharr option [6] designates the kernels\n\nbeginaligned\nmathbfH_x_1  =\nfrac132\nbeginbmatrix\n-3  -10  -3 \n0  0  0 \n 3  10  3\nendbmatrix\n\nmathbfH_x_2  =\nfrac132\nbeginbmatrix\n-3  0  3 \n-10  0  10\n-3  0  3\nendbmatrix \n = frac132\nbeginbmatrix\n    -1 \n    0  \n    1\nendbmatrix\nbeginbmatrix\n    3  10  3\nendbmatrix\n\n = frac132\nbeginbmatrix\n    3 \n    10  \n    3\nendbmatrix\nbeginbmatrix\n    -1  0  1\nendbmatrix\nendaligned\n\nSee also:  KernelFactors.scharr and Kernel.scharr\n\nKernelFactors.bickley\n\nThe bickley option [7,8] designates the kernels\n\nbeginaligned\nmathbfH_x_1  = frac18\n    beginbmatrix\n        -1  -4  -1 \n         0  0  0 \n         1  4  1\n    endbmatrix\n\nmathbfH_x_2  = frac18\n    beginbmatrix\n        -1  0  1 \n        -4  0  4 \n        -1  0  1\n    endbmatrix \n = frac18\n    beginbmatrix\n        -1 \n        0  \n        1\n    endbmatrix\n    beginbmatrix\n        1  4  1\n    endbmatrix\n\n  = frac18\n   beginbmatrix\n        1 \n        4  \n        1\n   endbmatrix\n   beginbmatrix\n        -1  0  1\n   endbmatrix\nendaligned\n\nSee also:  KernelFactors.bickley and Kernel.bickley\n\nChoices for border\n\nAt the image edge, border is used to specify the padding which will be used to extrapolate the image beyond its original bounds.

For example, mapwindow(median!, img, window) returns an Array of values similar to img (median-filtered, of course), whereas mapwindow(extrema, img, window) returns an Array of (min,max) tuples over a window of size window centered on each point of img.\n\nThe function f receives a buffer buf for the window of data surrounding the current point. If window is specified as a Dims-tuple (tuple-of-integers), then all the integers must be odd and the window is centered around the current image point. For example, if window=(3,3), then f will receive an Array buf corresponding to offsets (-1:1, -1:1) from the imgf[i,j] for which this is currently being computed.

The method transforms the distribution of the intensities in an image so that they are as uniform as possible [1]. The natural justification for uniformity is that the image has better contrast  if the intensity levels of an image span a wide range on the intensity scale. As it turns out, the necessary transformation is a mapping based on the cumulative histogram.\n\nOne can consider an L-bit single-channel I times J image with gray values in the set 01ldotsL-1 , as a collection of independent and identically distributed random variables. Specifically, let the sample space Omega be the set of all IJ-tuples omega =(omega_11omega_12ldotsomega_1Jomega_21omega_22ldotsomega_2Jomega_I1omega_I2ldotsomega_IJ), where each omega_ij in 01ldots L-1 . Furthermore, impose a probability measure on Omega such that the functions Omega ni omega to omega_ij in 01ldotsL-1 are independent and identically distributed.\n\nOne can then regard an image as a matrix of random variables mathbfG = G_ij(omega), where each function G_ij Omega to mathbbR is defined by\n\nG_ij(omega) = fracomega_ijL-1\n\nand each G_ij is distributed according to some unknown density f_G. While f_G is unknown, one can approximate it with a normalised histogram of gray levels,\n\nhatf_G(v)= fracn_vIJ\n\nwhere\n\nn_v = left  left(ij)   G_ij(omega)  = v right  right \n\nrepresents the number of times a gray level with intensity v occurs in mathbfG. To transforming the distribution of the intensities so that they are as uniform as possible one needs to find a mapping T(cdot) such that T(G_ij) thicksim U. The required mapping turns out to be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the empirical density hatf_G,\n\n T(G_ij) = int_0^G_ijhatf_G(w)mathrmd w\n\nOptions\n\nVarious options for the parameters of this function are described in more detail below.\n\nChoices for img\n\nThe histeq function can handle a variety of input types.

Hence preprocessing a raw image with an exponent of 1/γ  would have ensured a linear response to brightness.\n\nResearch in psychophysics has also established an empirical  power law   between light intensity and perceptual brightness.

If one interprets histograms as piecewise-constant models of probability density functions (see imhist), then the histogram matching task can be modelled as the problem of transforming one probability distribution into another [1].  It turns out that the solution to this transformation problem involves the cumulative and inverse cumulative distribution functions of the source and target probability density functions.\n\nIn particular, let the random variables x thicksim p_x and z thicksim p_z  represent an intensity in the source and target image respectively, and let\n\n S(x) = int_0^xp_x(w)mathrmd w quad textand quad\n T(z) = int_0^zp_z(w)mathrmd w\n\nrepresent their concomitant cumulative disitribution functions.

It differs from ordinary histogram equalization in the respect that the adaptive method computes several histograms, each corresponding to a distinct section of the image, and uses them to redistribute the lightness values of the image. It is therefore suitable for improving the local contrast and enhancing the definitions of edges in each region of an image.\n\nDetails\n\nHistogram equalisation was initially conceived to  improve the contrast in a single-channel grayscale image. The method transforms the distribution of the intensities in an image so that they are as uniform as possible [1]. The natural justification for uniformity is that the image has better contrast  if the intensity levels of an image span a wide range on the intensity scale. As it turns out, the necessary transformation is a mapping based on the cumulative histogram–-see histeq for more details.\n\nA natural extension of histogram equalisation is to apply the contrast enhancement locally rather than globally [2]. Conceptually, one can imagine that the process involves partitioning the image into a grid of rectangular regions and applying histogram equalisation based on the local CDF of each contextual region. However, to smooth the transition of the pixels from one contextual region to another,  the mapping of a pixel is not done soley based on the local CDF of its contextual region. Rather, the mapping of a pixel is a bilinear blend based on the CDF of its contextual region, and the CDFs of the immediate neighbouring regions.\n\nIn adaptive histogram equalisation the image mathbfG is partitioned into P times Q equisized submatrices,\n\nmathbfG =  beginbmatrix\nmathbfG_11  mathbfG_12  ldots  mathbfG_1C \nmathbfG_21  mathbfG_22  ldots  mathbfG_2C \nvdots  vdots  ldots  vdots \nmathbfG_R1  mathbfG_R2  ldots  mathbfG_RC \nendbmatrix\n\nFor each submatrix mathbfG_rc, one computes a concomitant CDF, which we shall denote by T_rc(G_ij). In order to determine which CDFs will be used in the bilinear interpolation step, it is useful to  introduce the function\n\nPhi(mathbfG_rc) = left(  phi_rc  phi_rcright) triangleq left(fracrP2 fraccQ2 right)\n\nand to form the sequences  left(phi_11 phi_21 ldots phi_R1 right) and left(phi_11 phi_12 ldots phi_1C right). For a given pixel G_ij(omega), values of r and c are implicitly defined by the solution to the inequalities\n\nphi_r1 le i le phi_(r+1)1  quad textand  quad  phi_1c le j le phi_1(c+1)\n\nWith r and c appropriately defined, the requisite CDFs are given by\n\nbeginaligned\nT_1(v)   triangleq  T_rc(G_ij) \nT_2(v)   triangleq  T_(r+1)c(G_ij) \nT_3(v)   triangleq  T_(r+1)(c+1)(G_ij) \nT_4(v)   triangleq  T_r(c+1)(G_ij)\nendaligned\n\nFinally, with\n\nbeginaligned\nt   triangleq  fraci - phi_r1phi_(r+1)1 - phi_r1  \nu   triangleq  fracj - phi_1cphi_1(c+1) - phi_1c \nendaligned\n\nthe bilinear interpolated transformation that maps an intensity v at location (ij) in the image to an intensity v is given by [3]\n\nv triangleq barT(v)  = (1-t) (1-u)T_1(G_ij) + t(1-u)T_2(G_ij) + tuT_3(G_ij) +(1-t)uT_4(G_ij)\n\nAn unfortunate side-effect of contrast enhancement is that it has a tendency to amplify the level of noise in an image, especially when the magnitude of the contrast enhancement is very high. The magnitude of contrast enhancement is associated with the gradient of T(cdot), because the  gradient determines the extent to which consecutive input intensities are stretched across the grey-level spectrum. One can diminish the level of noise amplification by limiting the magnitude of the contrast enhancement, that is, by limiting the magnitude of the gradient.\n\nSince the derivative of T(cdot) is the empirical density hatf_G, the slope of the mapping function at any input intensity is proportional to the height of the histogram  hatf_G at that intensity.  Therefore, limiting the slope of the local mapping function is equivalent to clipping the height of the histogram. A detailed description of the  implementation  details of the clipping process can be found in [2].\n\nOptions\n\nVarious options for the parameters of this function are described in more detail below.\n\nChoices for img\n\nThe clahe function can handle a variety of input types. The returned image depends on the input type. If the input is an Image then the resulting image is of the same type and has the same properties.\n\nFor coloured images, the input is converted to YIQ type and the Y channel is equalised. This is the combined with the I and Q channels and the resulting image converted to the same type as the input.\n\nChoices for nbins\n\nYou can specify the total number of bins in the histogram of each local region.\n\nChoices for xblocks and yblocks\n\nThe xblocks and yblocks specify the number of blocks to divide the input image into in each direction. By default both values are set to eight.\n\nChoices for clip\n\nThe clip parameter specifies the value at which the histogram is clipped.  The default value is three. The excess in the histogram bins with value exceeding clip is redistributed among the other bins.\n\nExample\n\n\nusing Images, TestImages, ImageView\n\nimg =  testimage(\"mandril_gray\")\nimgeq = clahe(img,256, xblocks = 50, yblocks = 50)\n\nimshow(img)\nimshow(imgeq)\n\nReferences\n\nR.

This approach is known as backward mode warping. The transformation tform must accept a SVector as input. A useful package to create a wide variety of such transformations is CoordinateTransformations.jl.\n\nReconstruction scheme\n\nDuring warping, values for img must be reconstructed at arbitrary locations tform(I) which do not lie on to the lattice of pixels. How this reconstruction is done depends on the type of img and the optional parameter degree.\n\nWhen img is a plain array, then on-grid b-spline interpolation will be used. It is possible to configure what degree of b-spline to use with the parameter degree. For example one can use degree = Linear() for linear interpolation, degree = Constant() for nearest neighbor interpolation, or degree = Quadratic(Flat()) for quadratic interpolation.\n\nIn the case tform(I) maps to indices outside the original img, those locations are set to a value fill (which defaults to NaN if the element type supports it, and 0 otherwise). The parameter fill also accepts extrapolation schemes, such as Flat(), Periodic() or Reflect().\n\nFor more control over the reconstruction scheme –- and how beyond-the-edge points are handled –- pass img as an AbstractInterpolation or AbstractExtrapolation from Interpolations.jl.\n\nThe meaning of the coordinates\n\nThe output array imgw has indices that would result from applying inv(tform) to the indices of img. This can be very handy for keeping track of how pixels in imgw line up with pixels in img.\n\nIf you just want a plain array, you can \"strip\" the custom indices with parent(imgw).\n\nExamples: a 2d rotation (see JuliaImages documentation for pictures)\n\njulia> using Images, CoordinateTransformations, TestImages, OffsetArrays\n\njulia> img = testimage(\"lighthouse\");\n\njulia> axes(img)\n(Base.OneTo(512),Base.OneTo(768))\n\n# Rotate around the center of `img`\njulia> tfm = recenter(RotMatrix(-pi/4), center(img))\nAffineMap([0.707107 0.707107; -0.707107 0.707107], [-196.755,293.99])\n\njulia> imgw = warp(img, tfm);\n\njulia> axes(imgw)\n(-196:709,-68:837)\n\n# Alternatively, specify the origin in the image itself\njulia> img0 = OffsetArray(img, -30:481, -384:383);  # origin near top of image\n\njulia> rot = LinearMap(RotMatrix(-pi/4))\nLinearMap([0.707107 -0.707107; 0.707107 0.707107])\n\njulia> imgw = warp(img0, rot);\n\njulia> axes(imgw)\n(-293:612,-293:611)\n\njulia> imgr = parent(imgw);\n\njulia> axes(imgr)\n(Base.OneTo(906),Base.OneTo(905))\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"function_reference/#Image-statistics-1","page":"Summary and function reference","title":"Image statistics","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"function_reference/#","page":"Summary and function reference","title":"Summary and function reference","text":"minfinite\nmaxfinite\nmaxabsfinite\nmeanfinite\nssd\nssdn\nsad\nsadn","category":"page"},{"location":"function_reference/#Images.minfinite","page":"Summary and function reference","title":"Images.minfinite","text":"m = minfinite(A) calculates the minimum value in A, ignoring any values that are not finite (Inf or NaN).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"function_reference/#Images.maxfinite","page":"Summary and function reference","title":"Images.maxfinite","text":"m = maxfinite(A) calculates the maximum value in A, ignoring any values that are not finite (Inf or NaN).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"function_reference/#Images.maxabsfinite","page":"Summary and function reference","title":"Images.maxabsfinite","text":"m = maxabsfinite(A) calculates the maximum absolute value in A, ignoring any values that are not finite (Inf or NaN).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"function_reference/#Images.meanfinite","page":"Summary and function reference","title":"Images.meanfinite","text":"M = meanfinite(img, region) calculates the mean value along the dimensions listed in region, ignoring any non-finite values.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"function_reference/#Morphological-operations-1","page":"Summary and function reference","title":"Morphological operations","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"function_reference/#","page":"Summary and function reference","title":"Summary and function reference","text":"dilate\nerode\nopening\nclosing\ntophat\nbothat\nmorphogradient\nmorpholaplace\nlabel_components\ncomponent_boxes\ncomponent_lengths\ncomponent_indices\ncomponent_subscripts\ncomponent_centroids\nfeature_transform\ndistance_transform","category":"page"},{"location":"function_reference/#ImageMorphology.dilate","page":"Summary and function reference","title":"ImageMorphology.dilate","text":"imgd = dilate(img, [region])\n\nperform a max-filter over nearest-neighbors.
